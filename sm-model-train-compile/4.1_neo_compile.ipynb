    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo-AI supports various frameworks and automatically optimizes models with minimal loss of accuracy. The Neo-AI compiler automatically optimizes the model for the target device's OS and hardware platform, and transforms the model into an executable form in a deep learning runtime. Deep Learning Runtime can perform inference with just two lines of code regardless of deep learning frameworks and edge devices, and the version is constantly updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, if you have an AWS account, you can use Amazon SageMaker Neo powered by Neo-AI. SageMaker Neo compiles models suitable for multiple target devices at the same time with one click on a few lines of code or UI, without any additional package or infrastructure setup, and without charging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Deep Dive) SageMaker Neo Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the SageMaker Neo Stack. Neo first optimizes the model with the compiler, and then runs the compiled model through the runtime in the cloud or on-device.\n",
    "\n",
    "For compiler part, the computational graph generator loads deep learning models trained on various deep learning platforms and reconstructs them into graph structures. It then converts the operators defined in the model into primiative operators to create a computational graph.\n",
    "After the graph is created, an optimized graph is created by applying various graph optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, hardware-dependent optimization considering the target hardware architecture on which the model will operate is not possible with only an optimized graph.\n",
    "Therefore, it is necessary to transform the computational graph into IR(Intermediate Representation), which is a form of hardware-dependent optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relay IR generates code after performing hardware-dependent optimizations such as memory allocation, parallelization, and execution order  based on the generated IR. For more details, please check the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted here that Apache TVM is not always used. Depending on the deep learning framework or hardware specifications, TensorRT or TreeLite is used. For NVIDIA GPUs, Neo uses TensorRT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the backend code generator generates backend code optimized for the target hardware architecture (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.) where the deep learning model workload will be deployed based on IR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime part is done through the DLR. It's only a few megabytes, not hundreds of megabytes like TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most model compilers perform graph optimizations as shown in the diagram.\n",
    "Graph optimization reduces the number of layers and computational complexity with techniques such as operator fusion, tensor fusion, and layer fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of calculating 1/sqrt(w) as an example of operator fusion. The graph before optimization requires a total of 2 operations with w > sqrt > div, but if $1/\\sqrt{w}$ is stored as a pre-computation value, no operation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure, three operations conv, bias, and Relu are bundled into one CBR (Conv, Bias, Relu) block to process consecutive operations in one function. This is called vertical layer fusion.\n",
    "Also, there are 3 overlapping 1x1 CBR blocks, which can be reduced to one block. This is called horizontal layer fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to NVIDIA's experiments, the total number of layers used in the ResNet-152 network was 670, but reduced to 159 through graph optimization.\n",
